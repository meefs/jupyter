# Sequential Chats and Customer Onboarding

This is an example inspired by `DeepLearning.AI`'s course [AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/).

It contains one flow with three assistant agents and one user proxy agent to handle the user's input. The personal information agent collects the user's name and location, the topic preference agent asks the user about their topics of interest, and the customer engagement agent uses the collected information and preferences to share engaging content.
