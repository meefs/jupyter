# Group Chat for Planning a Travel

In this example, we create a workflow to generate a travel plan using multiple agents with specific roles, working together in a group chat. The task is to plan a trip to a specific destination, considering local activities, language tips, and a final travel plan. The focus here is the usage of `Group Chats`, with a manager agent coordinating the workflow and delegating tasks to other agents.
