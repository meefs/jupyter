# Multi-Agent Conversation and Stand-up Comedy

This is an example inspired by `DeepLearning.AI`'s course [AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/).

It contains three flows, one that requires user's input, one that includes the first chat message (so no user input is required) and one that includes the first chat message and includes a termination criterion to automatically end the conversation.
