# Reflection and Blog post Writing

This is an example inspired by `DeepLearning.AI`'s course [AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/).

It contains a workflow for reviewing and improving blog posts using nested chats. The workflow includes roles for a writer, critic, and various reviewers (SEO, Legal, Ethics, and Meta). The `writer` writes blog posts based on given topics, the `critic` asks for reviews and provides feedback on the writer's work, the `SEO reviewer` optimizes content for search engines, the `legal reviewer` ensures content is legally compliant, the `ethics reviewer` ensures content is ethically sound, and the `meta reviewer` aggregates feedback from other reviewers.
